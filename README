Small application that extracts the first audio track it can find from an mp4 file
and sends it to stdout.

The application is based on the following libraries:

libevent - http://libevent.org/
libevhtp - https://github.com/ellzey/libevhtp

Compile:
gcc extract-audio.c -I /usr/include/evhtp/ -Wall -Werror -levhtp -levent -o extract-audio -O2

Run:
extract-audio -h <host> -n <port> -p <path>

Example:
./extract-audio -h distribution.bbb3d.renderfarming.net -p /video/mp4/bbb_sunflower_native_60fps_stereo_abl.mp4 | mpg321 -
